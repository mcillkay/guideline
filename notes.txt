complifications. generally want to avoid but think about them: 

categorical one off tasks. -send this letter, etc. 

weekly goals. maybe you don't want to do something daily, but only so much per week

also, week on, week off. say when it's your week with the kids, etc. how to do this?

think about what happens when someone changes their goal amount IN THE MIDDLE OF A DAY after already working on it some. the amount column of the timesheet will have different values within a single day, like: 
.25 
.25 
.25 
.5
.5  
if they shifted it up.

The other thing that Beeminder could really use is an upgrade on its design. Not sure what your thoughts are here but I would change most things. That’s just me of course. 

Also, the charts are nice, but they are hitting about 10% of their potential. There are many obvious things. The updates do not happen when the actual time is logged, but all time is aggregated to a single data point. It would be very easy to fix this, why not do it? All the lines and so forth are not really helpful. I can’t zoom in, overlay, look at averages, 

Beeminder is pitched as being for nerds, but what are you doing with all that data? What can I, as a user, do with it? Basically nothing. But this is the actual gold here, because users would LOVE to get metrics on their own performance and tips on how to improve etc. 

I can’t automatically set thresholds. I have a goal that is to do zero mg of caffeine. I derailed from it and now the new level is at 180 mg. I can’t instantly set it back to zero, I have to wait a week to do that, and while it is tapering down I have a week’s worth of caffeine to drink. Also lame. 

The deeper issue here is that there is no way of setting a goal to STAY ON TARGET. So if you go below or above it, you derail.
